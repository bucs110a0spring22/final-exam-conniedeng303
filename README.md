Summary of Program:
  The most prevalent memes that I found a lot across the Internet are those that state that they aquired the viewer's IP address. I decided to combine two APIs, one of which would tell me  the location of a random bird in the bird recording database, and where the location of the user's IP is. I first got data from the BirdrecordingAPI, and I then I tried to get the IP of the user and their location. The main function essentially figures out if the data from BirdrecordingAPI and IpfastAPI locations are the same. 

Most Challenging topic in the course:
  I felt like JSON related topics were difficult for me to understand.
